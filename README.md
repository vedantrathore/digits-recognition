## MNIST Digits Recognition

Welcome, This is my implementation multilayer Neural Network created using only the python's `numpy` package. It's based on the Neural Network from the book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/). I recommend reading that if you want to learn more.

### How to use
First make sure you [numpy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) installed.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vedantrathore/digits-recognition.git
$ cd digits-recognition/
$ wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/master/data/mnist.pkl.gz"
$ python network.py
```
