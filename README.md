## MNIST Digits Recognition

Welcome, This is my implementation multilayer Neural Network created using only the python's `numpy` package. It's based on the Neural Network from the book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/). I recommend reading that if you want to learn more.
